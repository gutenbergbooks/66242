_IMPORTANT ART BOOKS_

Published by SMALL, MAYNARD & COMPANY

ONE HUNDRED CARTOONS BY CESARE


Brilliant and powerful interpretations of our times, by the man whose
recent change from the _New York Sun_ to the _New York Evening Post_
gave the latter newspaper opportunity to congratulate itself on the good
fortune which had enabled it, when for the first time in its history it
decided to add a cartoonist to its regular staff, to obtain the services
of the ablest cartoonist in America. Cesare is more than a cartoonist:
he is an artist, and is known as such throughout this country, while his
work is reprinted in European periodicals more often than that of any
other American cartoonist. His greatness lies in his genius as an artist
as well as in the strength of the ideas that his drawings express.

     4to, boards, net, =$3.00=. Also, _edition de luxe_, printed on Japan
     vellum, limited to 105 copies, each numbered and signed by the
     artist, net =$7.50=


ART                                                 By Auguste Rodin

Translated from the French of PAUL GSELL by Mrs. ROMILLY FEDDEN

“A faithful reproduction by Paul Gsell of conversations with Rodin,
showing his direct practical attitude towards life and the meaning of
art, and repeating his interesting observations and ideas on such
special phases as realism, nature, movement, thought and mystery in art.
A notable and unique work. Of the 106 beautiful illustrations in
half-tone and photogravure, 67 reproduce Rodin’s work."--AMERICAN
LIBRARY ASSOCIATION _Booklist_.

     8vo. With a frontispiece in photogravure and 105 other
     illustrations. Buckram, net, =$3.50=; three-quarter levant, net,

JAN VERMEER OF DELFT                                By Philip L. Hale

“At last we have a book in English on Vermeer--an extremely valuable,
popular account. We get from such a book as this not only an
interpretation of a particular artist’s art, but also of the art of
painting in general. Writing about Vermeer in _The Outlook_ some years
ago, Mr. E. V. Lucas called him ‘the rarest and most fastidious of
masters.’ After reading Mr. Hale’s book one feels anew the justice of
that statement."--_Outlook._

“The most elaborate stylistic analysis ever applied to any
artist."--_Nation._

     Large 8vo. With reproductions in color, in photogravure and in
     half-tone of all of Vermeer’s known works, together with examples
     of the work of some of his contemporaries. Buckram, net, =$10.00=;
     three-quarter levant, net, =$20.00=.


LEONARDO DA VINCI                                   By Jens Thiis

“A beautiful and original book which deserves the extravagant praise
that it is worthy of its subject. The most vital of recent contributions
to the comprehension of Leonardo. It is a magnificent collection of
great pictures and drawings, for not only Leonardo but all his
contemporaries are exquisitely represented in it."--_Pall Mall Gazette_
(London).

     Large 4to. With 277 illustrations reproduced in tints and in black
     and white. Edition limited to 250 copies. Buckram, net, =$12.00=;

CHURCH BUILDING (_New and Enlarged Edition_)

More than a hundred collections, including the finest private galleries
of England, were, by the courtesy of their owners, made available for
the study which the author gave to the preparation of this extraordinary
